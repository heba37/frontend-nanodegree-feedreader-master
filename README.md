# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.




## How To Test?

1. test the `allFeeds` variable .
2. test suite named `"The menu"` ensures the menu element is hidden by default. 
3. test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. .
4. test suite named `"Initial Entries"`. that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work.
5.  test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`. that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.

##The Spec
1.Rss Feeds are defined , Has Url defined and not empty.

2. the menu hideen by defult.

3. the menu changes visibility.

4. initial entries not empty.

5. new feed selection is not the same of previous feed
